How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped show the typo filtering out extra interfering words.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see what changes I made to the files at which point of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I can choose what to save as a commit
    Cons: It would be terrible if I forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They were created intended for tracking different types of files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the whole list of history, and git diff shows the differences between 2 versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    The file can always be reverted back to a previous state so changes are not scary.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Some opensource projects.
