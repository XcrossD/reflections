When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to share a repo, a remote repository is much more easier.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It would be disasterous if the remote version is an older version and it overwrites the changes you made at the local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks: creating a copy of a repo on github servers
	clones: creating a copy locally or from remote to local
	branches: different versions within the same repo
