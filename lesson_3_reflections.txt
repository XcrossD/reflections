When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to share a repo, a remote repository is much more easier.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It would be disasterous if the remote version is and older version and it overwrites the changes you made at the local machine.
