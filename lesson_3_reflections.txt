When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to share a repo, a remote repository is much more easier.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It would be disasterous if the remote version is an older version and it overwrites the changes you made at the local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks: creating a copy of a repo on github servers
	clones: creating a copy locally or from remote to local
	branches: different versions within the same repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	We can know if the remote has changed and that if we need to merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would probably use dropbox or google drive for normal documents, but dropbox has trouble dealing with simultaneous editing and google drive is pretty laggy.
	Putting two different documents would be easier with git, but the setup is quite complicated.
